#  Lecture2Go Video Portal

The [media and distribution portal](https://lecture2go.uni-hamburg.de) software of the University of Hamburg is now available for other institutions of education in an open source version. The software is currently in further development for Liferay Version 6.2.

# The media distribution platform "to take away"

The Lecture2Go media distribution portal software is based on Liferay (liferay.com). All plugins for our software are being developed at the Regional Computer Center (RRZ) at the University of Hamburg.

Lecture2Go supports the free access to knowledge because this is a component of each democratic society. The open source software is aimed at academic institutions and its objective is to strengthen the blended learning.

# Installation (Linux, MAC)
Lecture2Go runs on Linux and Mac systems. The required hardware is depending on the usage of the portal. The following configuration has been implemented at the University  of Hamburg since year 2010.

## 1. System requirements
    Web server
        Operating system - SUSE 11 (x86_64)
        CPU – 16 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5640 @ 2.67 GHz
        RAM – 8 GB
        Hard drive – 500 GB
    Streaming server
        Operating system - SUSE 11 (x86_64)
        CPU – 8 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5430 @ 2.66 GHz
        RAM – 8 GB
        Hard drive – 4 TB. With this capacity, a large amount of videos are hosted. If a ninety minute 
        lecture recording does not exceed the data volume of 600 MB, so 4TB of storage would be sufficient for about 6500 videos.
        LAN – 1Gb. With this bandwidth and average transmission of 500 Kb/sec bit rate can be realized around 
        2000 simultaneous streams.
